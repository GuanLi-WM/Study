    I saw some Burma Shave style Signs on the side of the
    road today:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
       Passing cars, <br>
       When you can't see,<br>
       May get you,<br>
       A glimpse, <br>
       of eternity.<br>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I definitely won't be passingany cars."

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
    everything packed and ready to go.Because I'm on a Segway,
    I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    <ul>
    <li>cell phone,ipod,</li>
    <li>digital camera</li> 
    <li> and a protenin bar</li> 
    </ul>
    Just the essentials.As 
    Lao Tzu would have said,
    <Q>A journey of a thousand miles begins 
    with one Segway.</Q>
